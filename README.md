# MySQL_Superheroes
 SQL and PHP based superhero networking


## CRUD elements
 - Create new heroes
 - Add new abilities from pre-existing list to a hero's entry
 - Display hero information and connections
 - Update a hero's biography
 - Delete abilities from a hero's entry

### To-Do
 - Get edit bio field to prepopulate
 - Move submit new hero to its own page and place a link on the main page
 - Collect all the disparate functions into a data.php instead of just running them on separate pages
 - Clean up pages no longer in use
 - Clean up naming conventions
 - Check to make sure all variables are consistently named across pages
 - Style
 - Add images
 - Comment code

 ### Stretch goals
 - Make all fields of about editable, find a better solution than dividing up with accordions--edit button takes you to an edit page?
 - Add the ability to remove/add connections
 - Go look at Dave's code to use as a reference for injecting variables into html rather than echoing html
 - Set up image upload
 - Code golf
